# CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Our pipeline will build code, run unit tests, deploy to a container, and handle notifications and manual approvals. Additionally, we'll set up multi-environment deployments.

## Prerequisites

1. **Git and GitHub Account**: Ensure you have Git installed and a GitHub account.
2. **Docker**: Install Docker to manage containers.
3. **AWS Account (Optional)**: For deploying using AWS services like EKS, ECS, or Lambda.

Side note: This guide and demo will deploy to AWS, but this is not required for using CI/CD with github actions.

# First steps

In order to understand the basics of GitHub actions, we will make a 'hello world' example, where on a simple push to the main 
branch will start an action with the title of the user that made the push.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Click on the **+** icon and select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository, provide a description, and click **Create repository**.

For new github users, check out the [GitHub documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)

## Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions

1. Clone your repository localy ([GitHub documentation on cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
2. Step into the root of the repository. To make sure you are in the root, run `ls -a` and you should see a directory named `.git`
3. Inside the directory `./.githubactions/workflows`, create a file `ci-cd.yml` (Create both directories if necessary)

## Step 3: Create a new workflow

Inside the file created, copy the following code:
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
4. Remeber to save all changes
5. Commit and push the changes to origin (the github repository created)

In order to check that the action created was successfuly created, open your repository on GitHub and select the _actions_ tab. You should be able to see the action running or completed.

## Understanding the workflow
### name and run-name
The first two lines define the name of the workflow `name: GitHub Actions Demo`, and the title of each run of the workflow `run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ`.

GitHub provides parameters such as actor, action, etc. You can find the all in the [GitHub Actions documentation on contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts).

### Trigger

The next section defines how the workflow is triggered.
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```
Basically, the action will only be triggered when a push to the main branch is made. This can be on push, pull requests, issues, etc. Find more in [events that trigger workflows (GitHub Documentation)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows). 

### Jobs
A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs, which **run in parallel by default**. To run jobs sequentially, you can define dependencies on other jobs indicating that a given job `needs` another job.

Inside the workflow, the element `jobs` has a series of individual jobs identified by an `id`. 

<u>**Fields:**</u>
- `runs-on`: To define the type of machine to run the job on.
- `needs`: Is an optional field, which indicates that the job needs another job to finish in order to start the current one. 
- `steps`: A list of steps that the job will execute. Each step can either run a script or use an action.

```yaml
jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      ...
  job-2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job-1
    steps:
      ...

```

### Steps
A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an action in your 
repository, a public repository, or an action published in a Docker registry.

Each step has many fields, but the key ones are:

- `name`: A name for your step to display on GitHub.
- `uses`: Selects an action to run as part of a step in your job. An action is a reusable unit of code. You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a published Docker container image.
- `with`: A map of the input parameters defined by the action. Each input parameter is a key/value pair. Input parameters are set as environment variables.
- `run`: Runs command-line programs.

**For example**:
```yaml
jobs:
  terraform-init:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.0.0
          ...
```
